# Approach
​
1.  Initialize two variables `first` and `second`, each of equals to `Infinity`.
2.  Initialize `third` within the **for loop**. Each condition below is a if/else if/ else if.
3.  Compare `third` to `first`. If `third` is smaller then set `first = third`, meaning `first` is the smallest value.
4.  Compare `third` to `first` and `second`. If `third` falls between them, then `second = third`, meaning `second` is the middle value.
5.  Finally, compare if `third` is bigger than `second` and `first`. If true then return true, at the return false
